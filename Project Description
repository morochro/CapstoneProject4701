This project follows a structured three-step data analysis pipeline using the Rogensburg Pediatric Appendicitis dataset. In Milestone 1 (Preprocessing), the raw dataset was cleaned by assigning proper data types, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis. In Milestone 2 (EDA), we explored the dataset visually and statistically to identify patterns, detect outliers, and understand correlations among features. Finally, in Milestone 3 (PCA), we applied Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality, selecting five principal components that retained most of the data’s variance. These steps ensure the dataset is well-prepared for predictive modeling in the final stage.

Milestone 1 – Preprocessing (Milestone1 (Preprocessing).ipynb)
This notebook focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. It includes:

Loading the raw dataset
Converting data types (categorical vs. numerical)
Handling missing values using mode (for categoricals) and mean (for numericals)
Performing basic data cleaning and verification
Saving the cleaned dataset for use in future steps

✅ Outcome: A fully cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_dataset.csv.

Milestone 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Milestone 2 (EDA).ipynb)
This notebook explores the cleaned data to extract insights and understand patterns:

Visualizes key categorical features using pie and bar charts (e.g., Diagnosis, Severity)
Uses boxplots to identify potential outliers in numerical variables
Generates a correlation heatmap for numerical features
Helps understand feature relationships and target distribution before modeling

✅ Outcome: Key patterns and correlations discovered to guide feature selection.

Milestone 3 – PCA Dimensionality Reduction (Milestone 3 (PCA).ipynb)
This section applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality:

Standardizes numerical features using Z-score normalization
Computes and plots cumulative explained variance to determine optimal number of components
Selects 5 principal components for further use
Transforms the dataset into a lower-dimensional representation for model input

✅ Outcome: A reduced-feature dataset using PCA, retaining essential information.
